What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The .git file is added to the respository upon initialization. Without this file, which is hidden, it will not be recognized as a git repository, and the power of git will go unleashed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area has changes in it that have yet to be committed. This gives us the chance to review changes before committing.
