Reflection on lesson 1

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The plus and minus are a huge help in spotting what changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would make reverting back to an old version much faster and easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro is that commits are made at logical points. Con is that you could forget or make a bad call.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It depends on the content. Git is intended for web dev which involves many interdependencies between files. So it makes sense to save multiple files together, to track the interdependent changes among them.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will show you all commits, and git diff can show you the differences between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It helps to know that I can always revert to a previous version using Git.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Simple stuff, like version control duh. Gulp I hope I can figure it out.
